      "paragraphOne": "We present the idea of a fully autonomous modular home made from shipping containers.",
      "paragraphTwo": "After the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have considered building a home away from the noise of the city as an excellent option for living or vacationing.",
      "paragraphThree": "The demand for this type of housing, which gained popularity in the USA and Canada, has been growing in Spain in recent years.",
      "paragraphFour": "The choice of using shipping containers for building homes is because the structure of a shipping container is initially strong and proven, allowing for modular assembly, surface, and efficient transportation to the installation site. All modules are manufactured in the factory and require minimal work for installation. With modular design, you can plan the house of your dreams and ensure autonomous living without the need for utilities. Our home can not only be installed but also quickly moved to another location, as the modules are connected by screw method. The house is well insulated, equipped with life support systems. It is comfortable in both winter and summer, and the self-produced ventilated facade system and high-quality windows will add individuality to your home.",
      "paragraphFive_1": "Modular homes can be placed on lands where it is impossible to build a traditional house, as well as on rented lands. Typically, the land should be urban (terreno urbano), but for placing them in rural areas (rústicas), the final decision will be made by each Comunidad Autónoma, the competent authority for the management of undeveloped lands. All procedures for these types of housing involve expenses, which will be lower for mobile homes. A building permit is not required, but you will need certain documentation, such as a licencia urbanística, for which you need to pay a fee ranging from 0.5% to 2% of your home budget.",
      "link_five": "certain documentation",
      "paragraphFive_2": "such as licencia urbanística, for which you need to pay a fee ranging from 0.5% to 2% of your home budget.",
      "paragraphSix": "Mobile homes are exempt from the procedure for legalizing their use (cédula de habitabilidad certificate for habitation) with the payment of a tax that depends on each Comunidad Autónoma, a first occupancy license (licencia de primera ocupación), with which the administration certifies that the building complies with the project, with the payment of the corresponding tax if you do not want to declare expenses. In this case, you will need to obtain",
      "link_six": "documentation equivalent to immovable buildings.",
      "paragraphSeven": "We offer you not just a house, fully furnished and ready for a happy life, we offer you time for communication and self-improvement, for travel and love, while we will take care of YOUR HOME."
